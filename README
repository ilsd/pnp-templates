These instructions help you in installing the customized pnp4nagios templates in your nagios environment.
The template names are built up in this manner:

<command_name>.php

PNP4Nagios will automatically select the template with same name as the check plugin command_name.

Step by step instructions:

1. Check your version of pnp4nagios.If the directory "/usr/local/nagios/etc/pnp" exists, you got a 0.4.x pnp4nagios installation.
   Refer to http://docs.pnp4nagios.org/pnp-0.6/upgrade for upgrade instructions.
2. Copy all templates (check-netapp-PerfCpu.php, etc.) to the existing pnp4nagios directory "templates", at mostly /usr/local/pnp4nagios/share/templates.
   Please check your configuration paths for pnp4nagios.
3. set the permissions on the templates to 644, for example "chmod 644 check-netapp-*.php". 
   Owner shoud be the user for the nagios process.
4. Please adapt the given "netapp.cfg" for command configurations.
5. Restart nagios processes and check the graphs in your browser at http://your.nagioshost/pnp4nagios/ 
   or/and link them via an action_url, please check the given netapp.cfg-template.
